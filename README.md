# Smart Arduino-based Remote-Controlled Car with Emergency Braking, Parking Sensors, and IR Control

## Project Description:

This project involves the design and development of a miniature remote-controlled car powered by an Arduino microcontroller, enhanced with advanced smart features like emergency braking, parking sensors, and infrared (IR) control. The car is operated using an IR remote controller, offering a simple and intuitive method to drive the car while also ensuring safety and convenience through its smart systems.

## Key Features:

1. Remote Control via IR Controller:

* The car is controlled using a standard IR remote (e.g., TV remote or custom-made IR remote) that communicates with the Arduino via an IR receiver.

* The remote allows the user to send commands for basic car movements such as forward, backward, left, right, and stop, providing a straightforward and reliable control mechanism.

2. Emergency Braking System:

* The car features an emergency braking system that automatically stops the car in the event of an obstacle or when the emergency stop button on the IR remote is pressed.

* Ultrasonic or infrared sensors are used to detect obstacles. When an obstacle is detected within a predefined distance, the emergency braking system engages to prevent a collision.

3. Parking Sensors:

* The car is equipped with ultrasonic parking sensors at the front and rear to aid in parking and avoid collisions in tight spaces.

* These sensors continuously measure the distance to nearby objects and provide feedback via the car's movement or alert the user when the car is too close to an object, facilitating safer parking.

4. Motor Control and Drive Mechanism:

* The car is driven by DC motors controlled through an L298N motor driver. The driver allows precise control of the carâ€™s movement (forward, backward, left, right) based on commands from the IR remote.

* The L298N motor driver provides the necessary current and voltage to the motors, enabling smooth and responsive driving.

5. Safety and Obstacle Avoidance:

* The car uses ultrasonic or infrared sensors to detect nearby objects. The system triggers the emergency braking if an obstacle is detected in the path, preventing collisions and ensuring safer operation.

* The parking sensors provide additional safety features, helping the user navigate tight spaces without damaging the car.

6. Simple User Interface (IR Remote):

* The IR remote controller is the primary interface for controlling the car, allowing the user to send movement commands (forward, backward, left, right) and trigger the emergency stop.

* The system is designed to work with most standard IR remotes, with custom configurations that map buttons to specific car actions.

7. Battery-Powered System:

* The car is powered by a rechargeable battery pack, providing enough power to run the motors, sensors, and IR receiver module.

* The battery is designed for efficient power use to maximize runtime during operation.

## Project Objectives:

* To build a functional, IR-controlled remote car using Arduino, with integrated emergency braking and parking sensors for enhanced safety and usability.

* To design a reliable control system based on an IR remote, offering users an intuitive and efficient way to operate the car.

* To develop and implement smart features such as emergency braking and parking assistance, improving the car's safety and performance.
